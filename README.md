## Tech Stack

- Vite
- React
- PokeAPI

## Features

- 2 difficulty levels
- Real Pokemon data from PokeAPI
- Fully responsive for desktop and mobile

## What I learned

### React Concepts

- **State Management**: Used `useState` to manage score, cards, game status, and UI updates
- **Side Effects with** `useEffect`: Fetched PokÃ©mon data on mount and responded to game state changes
- **Component Architecture**: Built modular, reusable components
- **Event Handling**: Implemented click handlers with proper event propagation control

### UI/UX

- **Responsive Design**: Used Flexbox and media queries to ensure the game looks great on all devices
- **User Experience Focus**: Designed the game flow and interface to be intuitive and engaging, making it easy for users to understand how to play and enjoy the experience
- **Modal Design**: Created a reusable modal component with proper overlay handling, and consistent positioning to handle game over and game settings

### Algorithms

- **Fisher-Yates Shuffle**: Implemented this algorithm for randomizing card positions while maintaining fairness

### API Integration

- **Promise.all**: Leveraged to fetch multiple PokÃ©mon in parallel efficiently
- **Error Handling**: Managed loading states and potential API failures

### Best Practices

- **Code Organization**: Structured the project with separate components and styles
- **Performance Optimization**: Minimized unnecessary re-renders and kept state updates efficient
- **Clean UI**: Designed with visual hierarchy and consistent spacing for better readability and interaction
