## What I learned

### React Concepts

- **State Management**: Implemented state interactions between game logic, UI updates, and API data, with careful consideration of state dependencies and update timing
- **Performance Optimization**: Utilized React's StrictMode and optimized component re-renders through proper state management and event handling
- **Component Architecture**: Built modular, reusable components with clear separation of concerns
- **Event Handling**: Implemented event handling with proper event propagation control and state synchronization

### UI/UX

- **Responsive Design**: Used Flexbox and media queries to ensure the game looks great on all devices
- **User Experience Focus**: Designed the game flow and interface to be intuitive and engaging, making it easy for users to understand how to play and enjoy the experience
- **Modal Design**: Created a reusable modal component with proper overlay handling, and consistent positioning to handle game over and game settings

### Algorithms

- **Fisher-Yates Shuffle**: Implemented this algorithm for randomizing card positions while maintaining fairness

### API Integration

- **Promise.all**: Leveraged to fetch multiple PokÃ©mon in parallel efficiently
- **Error Handling**: Managed loading states and potential API failures

### Best Practices

- **Code Organization**: Structured the project with separate components and styles
- **Performance Optimization**: Minimized unnecessary re-renders and kept state updates efficient
- **Clean UI**: Designed with visual hierarchy and consistent spacing for better readability and interaction
